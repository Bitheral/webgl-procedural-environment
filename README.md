# Procedural Environment Generation

## Introduction

Procedural Environment Generation is a project that aims to create a procedural environment using WebGL technologies.

The project uses the following technologies:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org)
* [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

This project is in part of my dissertation for my BSc in Computer Games Development.

## Objectives

* Produce a procedural terrain using the Marching Cubes algorithm
* Procedurally place envrionmental objects across the terrain, accounting for the terrain's height
